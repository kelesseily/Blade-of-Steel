Game Prototype: Readme & ControlsThis document outlines the current features and player controls for our game prototype.Player ControlsKeyActionWASDPlayer Movement (Walk)MouseLook around (in First-Person) / Aim Camera (in Third-Person)Right-Mouse (Hold)(In Third-Person) Unlocks the camera to "free-look" around the character. Releasing snaps the camera back.VToggles the camera between First-Person and Third-Person views.XInteract with objects (when the prompt appears).Core Features Implemented1. Dynamic Camera SystemThe player can switch between a close-up, immersive first-person view and an over-the-shoulder third-person view at any time by pressing 'V'. In third-person, the camera smartly follows the player, but you can hold the right mouse button to look around freely.2. Intelligent Player MovementThe character's movement is context-aware:While Moving: The character automatically turns to face the direction you are pressing (relative to the camera).While Standing: Pressing left or right ('A' or 'D') will make the character turn in place without any awkward displacement.3. Weapon Interaction (Swap System)Players can interact with weapons found in the world.Pick Up: Walking up to a weapon displays an "Interact" prompt.Swap: If the player is already holding a weapon, interacting with a new one will "swap" them. The currently held weapon is dropped to the ground, and the new weapon is equipped.4. Interactive EnvironmentCertain objects in the world are interactive. The wall torches are the primary example:Players can walk up to a torch to get an interaction prompt.Pressing 'X' will toggle the torch, turning its light and particle flame on or off.The torchlight has a realistic "flicker" effect.5. World AtmosphereDay/Night Cycle: The world features a basic day-night cycle, with the directional light (sun) rotating to create a dynamic sky and atmosphere.Background Music: A looping audio track starts on game load to provide ambient music.Future ImprovementsThis prototype is a strong foundation, but there are clear areas for the next steps:Animation Polish: The current walking animation needs to be better synchronized with the character's movement speed to prevent the "ice skating" effect. We also need to add animations for turning in place.Advanced Weapon Interaction: We should expand the weapon system beyond just holding and swapping. This would include adding different attack animations (light/heavy), dealing damage, and managing stats for each weapon.
